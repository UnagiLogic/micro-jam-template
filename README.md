# Welcome to the Micro Jam!

# micro-jam-template

## The Challenge

Each micro-jam presents a unique theme or constraint for participants to work within. You'll have 5 days to be creative. Whether you're a beginner or experienced developer, the challenge is designed to encourage creativity and rapid prototyping.

## How to Participate

1. **Fork this repository** to create your own copy
2. **Navigate to the `module/` directory** where you'll find the basic template files
3. **Modify the `module.js` file** to implement your creative solution
4. **Test your creation** by opening `index.html` in your browser
5. **Share your work** with the community when you're ready.

The template provides a 800x800 pixel canvas and basic JavaScript structure to get you started.

## Rules

- **Time limit**: 5 days from the challenge announcement
- **Use the provided template**: Build upon the existing `module/` structure
- **Stay in the Canvas!**: All code and visuals must be contained *inside* the 800x800 canvas. Do not modify the `index.html` file or add new HTML elements. Your `module.js` file must be self-contained.
- **Keep it simple**: The goal is small, focused creations, not large projects
- **Be creative**: Interpret the theme in your own unique way
- **Have fun**: This is about learning, experimenting, and community building

Good luck and happy jamming! 🎵
